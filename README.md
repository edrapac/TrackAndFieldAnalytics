* Is there a big difference between 100m and 200m race model?
* Is there a big difference between what factors affect a good race 100 vs 200
* Is speed to a certain meter mark an indicator of success?
* How does stride length (# of strides) break down for the 100 (avg, distribution etc) and the 200, how do those compare at the 100m mark?
  1. Note we will need to use the 100 and 200m combined by athlete data for this
* How significant is Reaction Time in the 100 (correlated/stat signifigance) and 200? How does it differ between the 2?
  1. Note we will need to use the Diamond League data for anything regarding 200m splits at the 10m level of granularity, and the 200m_combined_by_athlete.csv for questions regarding reaction time
* Is deceleration of a certain % at a certain mark associated with a specific time? 
* What is more significant in the 200, speed out the blocks or holding off deceleration (speed endurance)? 
* What is more significant in the 100, speed out of the blocks or holding off deceleration (speed endurance)
